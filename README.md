### 2. **Intelligent Analysis**
Every conversation is analyzed using OpenAI GPT-4 to extract health insights, identify risk factors, and generate care recommendations.

### 3. **Predictive Healthcare**
Our machine learning model predicts hospitalization risk based on conversation data and patient history, enabling proactive care.

### 4. **Actionable Insights**
Caregivers receive comprehensive reports with specific recommendations for each patient through an intuitive dashboard.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB Atlas account
- VAPI API key
- OpenAI API key

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ruthie-ai.git
   cd ruthie-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:
   ```env
   MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key
   VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_vapi_phone_number_id
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. **Download the Hospitalization Prediction Model**
   
   The hospitalization prediction model file (`prevention_model/hospitalization_model.pkl`) is not included in this repository due to size limitations. You have two options:
   
   **Option A: Download from Release Assets**
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/ruthie-ai/releases) page
   - Download `hospitalization_model.pkl` from the latest release
   - Place it in the `prevention_model/` directory
   
   **Option B: Train Your Own Model**
   - Use the Jupyter notebook in `prevention_model/model.ipynb`
   - Follow the training instructions to create your own model
   - Save the trained model as `prevention_model/hospitalization_model.pkl`
   
   **Option C: Run Without Prediction Model**
   - The system will work without the model, but hospitalization risk prediction will be disabled
   - All other features (calls, analysis, dashboard) will function normally

5. **Run the complete pipeline**
   ```bash
   python complete_pipeline.py
   ```

6. **Launch the dashboard**
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the dashboard at: `http://localhost:5001`

## üìã **Usage Examples**

### **Making a Care Call**
```python
from complete_pipeline import run_ruthie_care_call

# Initiate a care call for a patient
results = run_ruthie_care_call(
    patient_id="patient_id_here",
    phone_number="+1234567890",
    max_wait_minutes=15
)

if results["success"]:
    print(f"Call completed successfully!")
    print(f"Patient Mood: {results['analysis']['mood']}")
    print(f"Risk Level: {results['analysis']['hospitalizationPrediction']['riskLevel']}")
```
